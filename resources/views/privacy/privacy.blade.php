                after the invoice creation and download process is complete.</li>
            <li>The data you enter is temporary and will be lost after you close the app or press the "Create" button
                and the invoice file is downloaded.</li>
            <li>Information sent to the server for PDF creation is encrypted during transmission to ensure security.
